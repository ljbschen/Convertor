# Convertor (Android App)
This is a useful unit convertor app that allows user to convert any length unit to other 12 units.
Utilized basic functionalities of android app such as option menu, spinner, xml design grid layout, multi Activities and fragments.
In order to convert all the units in a systematic way, cm is chosen as a base unit. Whenever a conversion is required, it will convert the current unit to cm and then convert from cm to the new unit. 
Technically, I applied OO Design concepts by designed a Quantity class with .to and .from APIs and a sub objective class Unit with values and corresponding ratios to cm.
